# Exam-Timetabling-Genetic-Algorithm

The genetic algorithm follows the structure of the course assignments. main.py implements all important functionality.
You can uncomment some of the lines just like in the assignment to test different functionality I implemented.
I left the code in the state that was the most effective, not necessarily the last thing I implemented or the version of
code that took the most effort.

alternative_solution.py must be run seperately if you want to see it.

I have included a saved population but you can change that file if you want to keep learning from another population,
or you can randomly initialize.
